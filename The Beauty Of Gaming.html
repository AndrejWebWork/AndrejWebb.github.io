       The word gaming originated in the 15th century to refer to gambling in dice or card games. Gaming was used to refer to gambling until the late 1900s, where it was applied to playing recreational board games and pen-and-paper role-playing games. 
       With the introduction of video games in the 1970s, the term gaming became more associated with its current use.
       Gaming has been around for decades and has changed with evolving technology. As systems got more complex, games got more in-depth and sensitive to player capabilities. Today's gamers use the best technology to compete at the highest levels. 
       Let's look at just how far gaming has come over the years with a history of video games and video game consoles.
       As early as the 1950s, computer scientists began designing simple games as simulations (way before Atari Pong). Some of the earliest games included Nimrod (1951), Strachey's Draughts Program (1951), Tic-Tac-Toe (1951), and Tennis for Two (1958).
       When higher performing computers came out, like the IBM 1560, games like Moon Landing, 3D Tic-Tac-Toe, and Spacewar! became more popular. However, these games were typically only available at top institutions, like MIT. 
       Gaming didn't get a lot of mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 80s.
